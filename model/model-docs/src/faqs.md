# FAQs

## For what purpose do you collect this information?

German Financial Cooperation uses project locations to report on the relevance, progress and impacts of our project portfolio. We create portfolio maps for the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development [BMZ](https://www.bmz.de/de) and for our internal and external stakeholders. We use location data to screen our porfolio for social, environmental or climate reated risks. Exact coordinates of the project locations are not shard with the public.

## How was your model developed and how is it related to the IATI standard?
The project location model is mostly based on a proposal of the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) to collect project specific geo-information. The IATI standard is used by international development organizations and allows to harmonize and coordinate development projects across multiple donor agencies. The IATI proposed standard was further developed to better reflect our operational needs. The project location model utilizes mostly predefined categories under the IATI standard. A main difference to the IATI standard is that the exising IATI list of location types has been expanded to cover all physical and immaterial location types required by international development cooperation standards.

## What are approximate locations and how to use them?
If no exact locations can be determined at the collection stage, approximate locations shall be used to report on the possible intervention areas. A common way to to so is to use **administrative areas** e.g. on level 1,2 or 3. If there is no official administrative area data at hand, we recommend to use fieldmaps.io as an adequate alternative ressource. If the projects already have a longlist of potential intervention sites with exact locations, then those locations shall be collected and reported within the data submission. In this case the field "activity status" shall be filled out with "Pipeline/identification" to highlight that the location is under study, but subject to change.
