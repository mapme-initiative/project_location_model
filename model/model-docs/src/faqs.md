# FAQs

**For what purpose do you collect this information?**
German Financial Cooperation uses project locations to report on the relevance, progress and impacts of our project portfolio. We create portfolio maps for the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development ([BMZ[(https://www.bmz.de/de))and for our internal and external stakeholders. We use location data to screen our porfolio for social, environmental or climate reated risks. Exact coordinates of the project locations are not shard with the public.

**How was your model developed and how is it related to IATI?**
The project location model is mostly based on a proposal of the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) to collect project specific geo-information. The IATI standard is used by international development organizations and allows to harmonize and coordinate development projects across multiple donor agencies. The IATI proposed standard was further developed to better reflect our operational needs. The project location model utilizes mostly predefined categories under the IATI standard. A main difference to the IATI standard is that the exising IATI list of location types has been expanded to cover all physical and immaterial location types required by international development cooperation standards.

**When should project location information be collected and updated?**
KfW strongly encourages the PEA or consultant to collect geo-coordinates as early as possible in the project cycle to increase the utilization potential of such data throughout the entire project cycle. Ideally, data should be collected already during the project preparation phase, e.g. as part of a feasibility study. Data can be updated if e.g. a project location changes or is specified more exactly during the project development or implementation phases. Data updates should be performed, ideally, on an annual base with the common progress reports, if not speficied differently. 

**What should be one in cas exact project locations are yet unknown or if they are subject to change?**
- If no exact locations can be determined at the collection stage, approximate location shall be used to report on the possible intervention areas. A common way to to so is to use **administrative areas** e.g. on level 1,2 or 3. If there is no official administrative area data at hand, we recommend to use fieldmaps.io as an adequate alternative ressource. 
- If the projects already have a longlist of potential intervention sites with exact locations, then those locations shall be collected and reported within the data submission. In this case the field "activity status" shall be filled out with "Pipeline/identification" to highlight that the location is under study, but subject to change. 

Once exact locations are known, this information shall be updated during the annual reporting processes.
