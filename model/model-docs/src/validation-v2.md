# Validation
You are required to validate your data before submission to KfW. This increases data quality at entry and reduces the need to go back and forth betweeen you and your project partners. You can do this manually by comparing your data to our requirements described in the [Annex of this guide](www.google.de). 

As an alternative you can also use our [online-validator](www.google.de) which accepts both GeoJSON and Excel files and also allows you to visualize submitted information on a map.
