# Introduction
Welcome to KfWs guide for collecting project location data in development cooperation. This website will teach you how to collect and validate location according to the specifications of our data-model. If you have any questions feel free to open a ticket in our [Github repository](https://github.com/mapme-initiative/project_location_model).

## Purpose(s)
This guide has three purposes: 
 - Support KfW project partners to submit geospatial information on project locations according to our data model 
 - Allow KfW project partners and KfW staff to validate submitted geo-information against our data model.
 - Describe the data model and its progression (version control) and serve as an open-source reference for other institution in the development cooperation sector.

## Intended Audiences

This guide has two main audiences: 
 - **KfW project partners** i.e. the project-executing agency (PEA) or a consulting entity assisting the PEA alongside project development and implementation phases. We recommend our partners to identify staff with knowledge of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to assist the data collection process.
 - **KfW staff:** Responsible staff for the data collection, verification and submission inside KfW.
