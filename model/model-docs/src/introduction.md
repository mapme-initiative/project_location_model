# Introduction

## KfW’s Project Location data collection and management approach

This section describes how Project Locations data should be collected, including information on technical requirements and expected formats; this guidance is intended for KfW staff, Project Executing Agencies (PEAs), consultants, and other external stakeholders responsible for data collection.


## What is a Project Location?

A Project Location is a set of one or more features that are part of a financially supported activity, where it is not feasible to make any further geographical distinctions with regards to funding. For instance, a financially supported hospital at a specific location is an example of a single-feature Project Location. Another example of a multi-feature Project Location is a group of adjacent agricultural plots that are being financed under an irrigation plan that benefits all producers in that area. A set of protected areas that are jointly financed from a single source of funding is another example of a multi-feature Project Location. However, if funding allocation can be further distinguished by smaller geographic areas, data across multiple Project Locations and the respective financial allocations must be collected. KfW strongly encourages capturing the geographical discrimination of financial flows to specific project locations where possible, which contributes to transparency and financial accountability.


## Project Locations Model 

The Project Location Model is a structured data model, developed by the KfW Development Bank, to collect location-specific information about projects supported by international development cooperation. The model is in use and continues to be developed by KfW, together with their peers and partners. 

The model, in Excel format, is currently available for download in [English](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openkfw/open-geodata-model/main/Project_Location_Data_Template_EN_V03.xlsx) and [French](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openkfw/open-geodata-model/main/Project_Location_Data_Template_FR_V03.xlsx). The model can be used in combination with a KML file. 

Data related to specific project locations should be collected with respect to the outlined requirements. Please see FAQ for more information about International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) standards and enhancements particular to KfW's operational needs.
