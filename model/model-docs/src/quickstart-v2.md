Welcome to KfW's guide for collecting project location data in development cooperation. This website will describe how to collect and validate project locations according to the specifications of our data-model. If you have any questions, please open a ticket in our [Github repository](https://github.com/mapme-initiative/project_location_model).

## Aims
This guide: 
 - Describes the data model and its development (version control) and serves as an open-source reference for other institutions in the development cooperation sector
 - Shows KfW project partners how to submit geospatial information on project locations, based on the requirements of our data model 
 - Enables KfW project partners and KfW staff to validate submitted geo-information against the requirements of our data model

## Intended audiences
This guide is prepared for: 
 - **KfW project partners** i.e. the project-executing agency (PEA) or a consulting entity assisting the PEA alongside project development and implementation phases. We recommend our partners to identify staff with knowledge of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to assist with the data collection process.
 - **KfW staff:** Responsible for the data collection, verification, and submission within KfW.
